Additionally, design engineers and safety inspectors must be equipped with a fundamental knowledge of various facets of materials science that will enable them to predict the long-term performance of components taking into account the materials composition and properties and the synergistic effects of various materials degradation processes. Consequently, it is critical that undergraduate students graduate with basic knowledge of materials science in nuclear engineering, in the same way they learn about reactor physics and reactor thermo-hydraulics. In addition, students will enroll in the \u201dReactor Design\u201d course with a knowledge of nuclear materials which will guide them to develop more mature designs.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"uw-pe uw-pe-featured_content\">\n<div class=\"uw-featured-content\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In response to the large and growing role of materials and materials-related issues in safe, efficient and economic operation of nuclear reactor systems, our introductory course in nuclear materials, NE423, has been transitioned from an &hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3146,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3146"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=278"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":279,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278\/revisions\/279"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=278"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=278"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/annualreport.ep.wisc.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=278"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
